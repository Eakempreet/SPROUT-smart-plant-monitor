# 🌱 SPROUT — Smart Plant Monitoring & Protection System

SPROUT is a small IoT-based system designed to monitor plant conditions and provide basic protection against external disturbances using sensors, local decision logic, and a microcontroller.

The project focuses on building a simple, reliable system that reacts to real-world conditions rather than theoretical scenarios.

## Motivation

The motivation for building SPROUT came from observing a recurring real-world problem.

Plants in open or semi-open environments are often damaged by small animals such as monkeys or squirrels. These animals disturb the soil, damage roots, or break stems—usually when no one is around to notice it in time.

SPROUT was built to act as a simple monitoring and protection layer. Instead of relying on constant human supervision, the system observes key conditions around a plant and responds locally when unusual activity is detected.

The aim was not to eliminate the problem completely, but to reduce unnoticed damage through timely awareness and basic deterrence.
