# 🌱 SPROUT — Smart Plant Monitoring & Protection System

SPROUT is a small IoT-based system designed to monitor plant conditions and provide basic protection against external disturbances using sensors, local decision logic, and a microcontroller.

The project focuses on building a simple, reliable system that reacts to real-world conditions rather than theoretical scenarios.
